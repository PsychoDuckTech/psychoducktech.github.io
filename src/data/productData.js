  {
    question: "What makes the ortholinear layout better for typing?",
    answer: "The ortholinear layout arranges keys in a grid pattern rather than the traditional staggered layout. This reduces finger travel distance and provides a more ergonomic typing experience, potentially increasing typing speed and reducing strain."
  },
  {
    question: "How do the magnetic modules attach to the keyboard?",
    answer: "The modules connect via strong neodymium magnets embedded in both the keyboard and modules. They snap into place with precision alignment and communicate through pogo pin connectors, requiring no additional cables."
  },
  {
    question: "What is PsychOS and what can it do?",
    answer: "PsychOS is our custom keyboard operating system that enables advanced features like keystroke prediction, custom macros, and adaptive key sensitivity. It also allows for seamless integration with the side display and volume knob for real-time feedback and control."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the RGB underglow?",
    answer: "Yes, the RGB underglow is fully customizable through the Web Configurator. You can set static colors, dynamic patterns, or even program it to react to your typing."
